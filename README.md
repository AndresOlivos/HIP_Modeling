# HIP_Modeling
### This folder contains the code used for the modeling and analysis of stream habitats based on drainage models derived from Digital Elevation and Precipitation models. Most of these scripts operate through the user interface of ArcGIS Pro 2.X (ESRI, 2021), although individual scripts can also be used through any Python editing program. The use of these geoprocessing scripts require DEMs and precipiation models to use metric units (meters above the level of the sea and cubic meters, respectively) and a metric coordinate system.
